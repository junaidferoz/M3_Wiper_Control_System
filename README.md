# M3_Wiper-Contorol-System
* This project is all about designing a wiper control system for cars. 
* We use STM32cube IDE and Qemu for emulating the operation. 
* As qemu supports only 4 LEDs and a Switch, we make use of LEDs to notify the operations.
* We denote intensity of rain by the frequency in which the lights alternate between the four colours.
* The switch indicates ON/OFF <br><br>

# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
* In automobiles, particularly cars, autos and heavy vehicles, there are wipers. 
* Wipers are used to clean the windshield of the cars
* to operate these wipers, motors are used. these motors are designed to operate in 90 degrees or 150 degrees, depending on the use.
* I have not used 180 degrees here, because no wiper in real time rotates 180 degrees.
* As STM32IDE is used, along with Qemu, we will show this operation using only 4 LEDs and a switch.
* This is so because Qemu supports only those things.
* We use single press and long press to denote ON/OFF and frequencies to denote varoius wiper operations.
